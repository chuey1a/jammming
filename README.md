# React app to create custom spotify playlists

The app will be able to take in your account details and then add them to a playlist which can then be added to your account.

The user can search spotify and then select their desired tracks. Adding these tracks to a playlist they choose the name of.


## Future Work: 
Add ability for any user to enter their spotify login details.
Add song suggestions based off of what has been added to the newly selected playlist.
